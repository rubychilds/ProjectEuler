This is for my solutions to Project Euler.

You can find the Project Euler webite <a href='http://projecteuler.net/'>here</a>

Most of my solutions are in Python, but will soon be in Scala as well. The main reason for working on Project Euler is as a learning process. This began when I started teaching myself Python at HackerSchool and am now recently teaching myself Scala.
